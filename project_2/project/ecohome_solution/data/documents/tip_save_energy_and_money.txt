Tips & tricks for saving energy in your home from https://www.ewz.ch/en/private-customers/electricity/save-electricity/energy-saving-tips.html

Oven
- Avoid preheating. It’s not usually necessary.
- If the cooking time is longer than 40 minutes, you can turn the oven off ten minutes before the end. The residual heat will be enough.
- Bake in convection mode on several levels at the same time.

Lighting
- Don’t leave lights on unnecessarily.
- Switch to energy-efficient LED bulbs. They offer an energy saving of up to 80%.

Dishwasher
- Make full use of the machine’s capacity.
- Use the eco programme for lightly soiled dishes.
- Wash small quantities of dishes by hand, but don’t keep the water running when you do so.
Hob
- Use an insulated pan with a closed lid.
- Use a pressure cooker if it’s a long cooking time.
- Make sure that the diameter of the pan and the hob ring match.
- Reduce the heat early and use the residual heat.

Fridge/freezer
- Set it to the correct temperature: Fridge 5 to 7°C, freezer -18°C.
- Don’t open the door any more than necessary and keep the air vent clear.
- Let hot food cool down before putting it in the fridge.
- Thaw frozen foods in the fridge.
- Defrost your appliances regularly.

Standby-electricity-consumption
- Most appliances still use electricity when in standby mode.
- Always switch your television, hi-fi, computer or coffee machine off completely.

Hot water
- Use cold water instead of warm water for short periods of use.
- Use efficient shower heads.
- Heat the water to a maximum of 60 °C and descale the boiler regularly.

Washing machine
- Wash at as low a temperature as possible. With today’s detergents, 20 °C to 30 °C is sufficient for normally soiled laundry.
- Avoid pre-washing lightly soiled items and make full use of the machine’s capacity.
- Do washing that needs a hot wash at 60°C instead of 95°C. Special detergents will make sure that your whites don’t go grey.

Tumble dryer
- Whenever possible, always dry your laundry outdoors.
- Spin your laundry at a minimum of 1,400 revolutions per minute.
- Fill the tumble dryer completely and dry light and heavy fabrics separately.
- Clean the air filter after every use, otherwise there is a risk of fire.
